Description

This project is a traffic sign detection and classification system on images using OpenCV and jupyter notebook . The detection phase uses Image processing techniques to classify them into the 43 classifiers used in our project.
Images are fed into lists that are then converted to arrays and stored along with their class labels . Training is done on these 43 classes which is then being tested on during the testing phase .
